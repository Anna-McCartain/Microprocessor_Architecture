# Microprocessor_Architecture
Some of my second year coursework building the STUMP processor in verilog; then using it to build a project on FGPA board. 
My project was a festive delight, starting with the RGB LED screen spiraling into a present image, then across the LED screen 
numbers correlating to the calculator values appeared. Once hitting the keys in sequence a rendition of jingle bells was played.
